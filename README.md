# CERN-Project 
## Jinyao Tian

This project is one of major projects I accomplished at Utrecht University, Netherlands. Our study group cooperated with The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and the main goal is the devise a predictive system to warn the operators beforehand that the beam might decay, as well as to get better insight into what causes these dacays.

In this project, I am mainly focused on building and testing XGBoost model. My main jobs are:
  • Improved performance of Neural Network model by using Exponential Rolling Average method to remove stochastic noise from Sensor data.
  • Collaborated Dimensionality Reduction team and applied XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) with Python to devise a predictive system to warn operators beforehand beam current might decay, increasing the Prediction accuracy by 40%.
  • Deployed the XGBoost model with well-tuned parameters to predict for three important regions and accurately captured change trend of beam current.
